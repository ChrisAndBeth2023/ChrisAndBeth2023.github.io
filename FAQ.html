          Jeans that are not blue are ok (ex. black, brown, grey). As well as casual dresses

            neckties, bowties, floor length gowns as an example as the setting will be in a barn.

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-main-color">What type of food and drink will be served at cocktail hour and the reception?</h6>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Tons of delicious food! </u></strong>We will be having an ice cream social following the ceremony for our “cocktail hour”. We will have a selection of different ice cream in our cart near the venue. We will also have several nonalcoholic drinks to choose from including soda, 
          diet sodas, water, and lemonade. We will be serving a pizza buffet with several of our favorites! 
          We will also have wings. Banana pudding will be our dessert for the evening.</p>

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-main-color">Will you be serving alcohol?</h6>
        <p>
          <strong><u>No we will NOT be allowing alcohol </u></strong> Due to the policy of the venue not allowing alcohol to be brought or served without
          a licensed bartender and the extensive costs of insuring this, we will not allow alcohol at the wedding. *This includes ALL Alcohol, liquors, spirits, etc.*</p>

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-main-color">Will the ceremony, “cocktail hour”, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?</h6>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Depends on the weather!</u></strong> We will be holding our ceremony outside the venue at the gazebo. We will be providing a cooler with water as well as paper fan programs. If you need a break from the heat the barn will have A/C you can step in for a bit before the ceremony starts. We will ask all guests to take their seats at least 15 minutes before we start though.</p>
          <p>Our ice cream social hour will be outdoors near the ice cream cart. Feel free to find your table on the seating chart and make your way inside around this time and sign in!</p>
          <p><strong>The reception will be indoors completely.</strong>
          This will all be weather permitting. If it happens to rain that day, we will adjust to an all indoor event if need be.</p>

        <h6 class="mb-3 text-main-color">What will the weather be like?</h6>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Hot like our love!</u></strong> This time of year in North Carolina it will be hot. Please dress accordingly. 
          I would suggest not to wear dark colors since we will be outside for a portion. 
          The barn does have A/C if any of our guests need to cool down. 
          Sometimes rain can also happen around this time of year. If there’s rain, and if it doesn’t last long, 
          we will go on with the show just at adjusted times. 
          If it does last a while, we will adjust to an indoor event.</p>
